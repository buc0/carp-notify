Revision history for Perl extension Carp::Notify.

1.13  2016-04-05
        - Gratuitous version bump because the author botched an upload of
          Carp-Notify-1.12.tar.gz and CPAN doesn't allow an upload name to be
          reused (for understandable reasons)

1.12  2016-03-31
        - Fix tests relying on hash ordering
        - change to 'use warnings' instead of messing with $^W
        - eliminate conditional 'my' statements
        - fix doubled adding of 1900 to the year
        - document some additional known edge cases (bugs)
        - removed 'test.pl'
        - made loading of Socket required
        - minor changes to address Perl::Critic criticisms

1.11  2013-02-01
        - Maintainership changed to Brian Conry
        - Updates to documentation, tests, and whitespace

1.10  Fri Apr 13 2001
        - Long overdue re-write/enhancements.
        - Cleaned up the internals.
        - Added support for different log files for notifys/explodes.
        - Added support for changing all the defaults externally.
        - Improved today() function with Mail::Bulkmail's date generation.
        - Added death_function to call upon dying instead of death_message.
        - Added error_function to help handle unforeseen problems.
        - Perl 5.6's 'caller' function returns an extra two fields of
          information.  Jeff Boes pointed this out and extra-helpfully
          provided a patch for it as well.
        - Added the ability to config the SMTP port.  I was just being lazy
          in v1.00.  :*)

1.00  Thu Aug 10 2000
        - Changed the name from Explode to Carp::Notify.  It's more
          descriptive and I don't create a new namespace.

1.00-FC1  Fri Jun 09 2000
        - First publically available version.

0.01  Thu Apr 12 14:59:17 2001
