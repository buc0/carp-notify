Revision history for Perl extension Carp::Notify.

1.11  <TBD>
        - Maintainership changed to Brian Conry
        - Updates to documentation, tests, and whitespace

1.10  Fri Apr 13 2001
        - Long overdue re-write/enhancements.
        - Cleaned up the internals.
        - Added support for different log files for notifys/explodes.
        - Added support for changing all the defaults externally.
        - Improved today() function with Mail::Bulkmail's date generation.
        - Added death_function to call upon dying instead of death_message.
        - Added error_function to help handle unforeseen problems.
        - Perl 5.6's 'caller' function returns an extra two fields of
          information.  Jeff Boes pointed this out and extra-helpfully
          provided a patch for it as well.
        - Added the ability to config the SMTP port.  I was just being lazy
          in v1.00.  :*)

1.00  Thu Aug 10 2000
        - Changed the name from Explode to Carp::Notify.  It's more
          descriptive and I don't create a new namespace.

        - First publically available version.

0.01  Thu Apr 12 14:59:17 2001
